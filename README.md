# Up-To-Date
This is a full stack application that I built to get the latest news, weather and other miscellaneous updates. 

The technologies that I used to build this app were:
-HTML
-CSS (Flexbox and CSS GRID)
-SASS
-Javascript
-NodeJS with Express.

The updates are gather from a few different api including OpenWeahterMap and NewsAPI.

STYLING
The layout is rather simple and responsive (Desktop and Mobile). The layout was created mostly with Flexbox and CSS Grid. I decided to use SASS as a preprocessor as it helped with declaring different variables for the containers and allowed for an overall more organized style guide. There are a few imported icons from fontawesome and a font from Google fonts.  

JAVASCRIPT
The javascript is written almost entirely in ES6+ syntax (fetch, async await). I decided to use a nodeJS with Express as a server as the main api (news) called for it, so I made all of the calls from the server. 

Dependencies
-dotenv ( hide api keys)
-epxress (to run with node)
-node-fetch (to use fetch in node)
-sass (preprocessor for css)
